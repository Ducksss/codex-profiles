## Unreleased

### Added

- `list` command for read-only initialized profile discovery.
- `version` and `--version` output.

### Changed

- All-profile `status` now skips unmanaged reserved-alias directories and
  invalid `.codex-*` directory names during discovery.

### Tests

- Added coverage for CLI/login argument pass-through, invalid profile names,
  list output, version output, and hardened status discovery.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- Desktop app switching now waits for both the main Codex app process and the
  bundled Codex app-server process to stop before launching a new profile.
- Profile directory permission setup now fails loudly if private permissions
  cannot be applied.
- `status` no longer creates missing profile directories.
- `status` now propagates unexpected Codex CLI failures while still treating
  "Not logged in" as a normal status result.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-04-25

- Initial `codex-profile` CLI.
- Profile-aware commands for Codex CLI, Codex Desktop, login, status, path, and
